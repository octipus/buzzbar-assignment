## Web Developer Assignment:

Mike is a new client that just walked into our shop. He is the founder of a new company called Lorem Ipsum, which produces and sells brain-boosting energy drinks for young SEOs and alike.

Mike doesn't have any current branding guidelines but he has a logo (attached, but only in a bitmap format for now, unfortunately). He is asking us to build a website for his brand, where he can sell the drink and explain its key benefits, which are: "Increased brain power", "Increased memory", "No more need to sleep". Meanwhile, he needs to have a landing page online asap, as he's meeting prospective investors in the coming days.

Your task is to build a draft of this landing page in around 3h in order to present it to the client on the next meeting.


## These are the guidelines Mike gave us:
* The landing page needs to show:
     - the logo
    - a tagline
    - a small blurb about the drink
    - an interesting way of showing the 3 key benefits of the drink
    - a form to collect email addresses
*  He wants the website to look cool and fresh, not cheesy-looking;
* Needs to distance themselves from other well-known energy drinks such as Redbull or Monster
*  He wants the key benefits to be explained in a simple way but they should be the central and more memorable part of the landing page, he mentioned it would be nice to have some kind of animated and/or interactive elements. "Surprise me!" he said.
*  He wants us to pick the fonts according to what we think would be on-brand.

### For the sake of simplicity, on this exercise:

* The email collection form doesn't need to be functional;
* You don't need to worry about copy, feel free to use placeholder content;
